# Bluetooth Low Energy Timer App

This Android application facilitates establishing a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection between an Android smartwatch and an Arduino microcontroller. The main features of this application include:

## Timer Functionality
Users can set a timer within the application. Upon reaching the end of the set time duration, a message is sent to the connected Arduino microcontroller.

## Warning Notifications
Additionally, users have the option to configure warning notifications. These notifications are sent to the Arduino microcontroller when a certain amount of time is remaining on the timer.

## Usage
To utilize this application, follow these steps:

1. Install the application on your Android device.
2. Ensure that your Android device supports Bluetooth Low Energy.
3. Pair the Android smartwatch with the Arduino microcontroller.
4. Set the desired timer duration within the application.
5. Optionally, configure warning notifications as needed.
6. Start the timer and monitor its progress.

## Note
This application is designed to demonstrate BLE communication between an Android device and an Arduino microcontroller for timer functionality. It can be customized or integrated into larger projects as required.
